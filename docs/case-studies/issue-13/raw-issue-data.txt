=== ISSUE SUMMARY ===

Two main issues identified:

1. WARNING: Dead code - methods `set_use_simd` and `is_simd_enabled` are never used
   Location: src/gpu_radix_sort.rs:157 and :162
   These are public methods defined in the GpuRadixSorter implementation but never called

2. ERROR: GPU radix sort (SIMD) failed verification!
   The SIMD-optimized scatter kernel produces incorrect sorting results
   The data is not properly sorted after the SIMD scatter operation
   Non-SIMD version works correctly, only SIMD version fails
